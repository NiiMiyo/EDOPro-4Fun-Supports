# Nii Miyo's For Fun Custom Cards

Made with [EdoEx](https://github.com/NiiMiyo/EdoEx), this project is an expansion for [EDOPro](https://github.com/ProjectIgnis/EDOPro) with cards that support archetypes I like to play but I think can have better support.

## Warnings

- Since I can't draw very good, card artworks were done by AI.
- This expansion uses set code `0xf03` for **every** card. This set is called `Nii Miyo - 4Fun Supports` and it's purpose is to make searching the cards easier by typing `@4Fun Supports` in the search bar (or `@Nii Miyo` if you have any other of my expansions).
